Software Engineering Boot Camp - Task 10

Compulsory Task 1
Follow these steps:
● Create a Python file called “Control.py” in this folder.
● This is going to expand on the first control structure task we created.
● Write code to take in a user’s age using input() and store their age in an
integer variable called age.
● Then check if the user’s age is over 18. If the user is over 18, print out the
message “You are old enough!” else if they are over 16 print “Almost there”,
otherwise print “You’re just too young!” You should use one if, elif and else
statement to do this.

Compulsory Task 2
Follow these steps:
● Create a new Python file in this folder called “Optional_task.py”
● Create a program that calculates a person's BMI
● Ask the user to enter their weight in kg and their height in m
● Use the formula below to calculate the user's BMI:
BMI = (weight in kg) / ((height in m)*(height in m))
o If the users BMI is 30 or greater the user is obese
o If the users BMI is 25 or greater the user is overweight
o If the users BMI is 18.5 or greater the user is normal
o If the users BMI is less than 18.5 the user is underweight
● Display the users BMI and whether they are obese, overweight, normal or
underweight.
